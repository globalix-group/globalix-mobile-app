## ❓ COMMON QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

**Q: "What's your customer acquisition strategy?"**
A: "Multi-channel: Direct B2B sales to agents, digital ads targeting HNWIs, partnerships with banks and wealth managers, referral program, and content marketing. We've budgeted $525K (35% of funds) for marketing with a target CAC of $150."

**Q: "How do you compete with Zillow?"**
A: "We don't - different markets. Zillow is mass market, we're luxury. They're desktop-first, we're mobile-native. They're ad-supported, we're commission-based. Our customer pays $1.5M average vs their $300K. It's like comparing Walmart to Saks Fifth Avenue."

**Q: "What if Sotheby's builds a mobile app?"**
A: "They could, but: 1) We're 2-3 years ahead in technology, 2) They lack the tech DNA and culture, 3) We have the integrated car rental advantage, 4) Our lower commission model works because we're tech-first. Plus, by the time they react, we'll have network effects."

**Q: "Why can't this be easily copied?"**
A: "Three moats: 1) Technology lead (2-3 years), 2) Integration complexity (real estate + cars requires expertise in both), 3) Network effects once we scale. We're not relying on one defensible asset."

**Q: "What's your burn rate?"**
A: "First 6 months: ~$65K/month. Months 7-24: ~$85K/month as we scale marketing. The $1.5M gives us 24 months runway with buffer to reach cash-flow positive at month 30."

**Q: "Who are your target customers?"**
A: "Primary: High-net-worth individuals ages 28-55, $200K+ income, tech-savvy, international investors and expats. Secondary: Luxury real estate agents and high-end car rental companies. Geographic: USA, UK, UAE, Singapore initially."

**Q: "Have you talked to customers?"**
A: "[If yes, share. If no:] We're pre-launch, but our market research shows 75% of luxury searches are mobile, 60% abandon due to poor UX, and agents spend 20+ hours/week on manual tasks. The problem is validated by industry data."

**Q: "What's your plan if you don't raise the full $1.5M?"**
A: "Minimum viable raise is $750K which gives us 12 months to launch in one city and prove PMF. Preferred is $1.5M for 24 months and multi-city expansion. Above $2M we'd accelerate international expansion."

**Q: "When do you need the money?"**
A: "We're aiming to close in the next 8-10 weeks. We have interest from several angels and one VC, so we expect to close the round by [insert date 8-10 weeks out]."

**Q: "What keeps you up at night?"**
A: "Honestly, execution speed. The opportunity is so clear, the market is so big, I just want to move faster. That's why we need this capital - to hire the team and capture market share before anyone else sees what we see."
