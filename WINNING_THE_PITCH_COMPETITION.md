### WEEKS 7-8: CLOSING THE ROUND

#### Managing Multiple Investors

**Create a Momentum:**
- "We're in active discussions with several investors"
- "We expect to close the round by [date]"
- "Two other investors have expressed strong interest"

**Set a Deadline:**
- "We're planning to close in 3 weeks"
- "First commitments get better terms"
- "We may be oversubscribed"

**Stay Organized:**
- Track every conversation in your spreadsheet
- Note: Interest level (Hot, Warm, Cold), Amount discussed, Timeline
- Follow up regularly but not annoyingly (once per week max)

#### Due Diligence Phase

**Be Prepared to Provide:**
- [ ] Articles of incorporation
- [ ] Cap table (current ownership)
- [ ] Intellectual property documentation
- [ ] Full financial model with assumptions
- [ ] Technical architecture documentation
- [ ] Customer testimonials (if any)
- [ ] Market research sources
- [ ] References (personal and professional)
- [ ] Background check authorization

**Create a Data Room:**
- Use Google Drive or Dropbox
- Organize all documents clearly
- Share with serious investors only
- Track who accesses what

#### Negotiating Terms

**Key Terms to Negotiate:**
- Valuation (pre-money and post-money)
- Investment amount
- Equity percentage
- Liquidation preference (aim for 1x non-participating)
- Board seats (maintain control)
- Pro-rata rights (okay to give)
- Anti-dilution protection (try to avoid or minimize)

**When to Get a Lawyer:**
- Once you have a verbal commitment
- Before signing any term sheet
- For all legal documentation
- Budget $5K-$15K for legal fees

**Red Flags (Walk Away If):**
- Investor wants control (>50% equity or board control)
- Unreasonable terms (high liquidation preference, full ratchet anti-dilution)
- Bad reputation (research their portfolio companies)
- Misaligned values or vision
- Too much interference in day-to-day operations

#### Closing the Investment

**Steps:**
1. Verbal commitment
2. Term sheet signed (non-binding usually)
3. Due diligence (2-4 weeks)
4. Legal documentation (Stock Purchase Agreement, Shareholders Agreement)
5. Wiring funds (usually within 5 business days of signing)

**Celebrate!** 🎉

## 🎯 SPECIFIC TIPS FOR PITCH COMPETITIONS

### If Your Program is a Formal Competition:

**Understand the Format:**
- [ ] Time limit for pitch (5, 10, or 15 minutes?)
- [ ] Q&A time (5, 10, 15 minutes?)
- [ ] Judges' backgrounds (research them)
- [ ] Evaluation criteria (ask for rubric)
- [ ] Prize structure (winner, runner-up, etc.)
- [ ] Recording/streaming? (practice for camera)

**Tailor Your Pitch:**
- Start with a hook (60% abandon due to poor UX)
- Focus on criteria that matter (usually: market, traction, team, innovation)
- Show, don't tell (demo is powerful)
- End with memorable statement
- Stay within time limit (practice!)

**Handle Q&A Like a Pro:**
- Listen carefully to entire question
- Pause before answering (shows you're thinking)
- Answer directly and concisely
- If you don't know, say "Great question, I'll find out"
- Never argue with judges
- Show humility but confidence

**Stand Out:**
- Professional attire (suit or business casual)
- High-quality slides (hire designer if needed)
- Compelling demo (practice 20+ times)
- Confident delivery (not arrogant)
- Energy and passion (smile!)
- Memorable facts (30:1 LTV/CAC, $2.3T market)

---

## 💪 MENTAL PREPARATION

### Handling Nerves

**Before Pitch:**
- Deep breathing exercises (4-7-8 technique)
- Power poses (2 minutes in private)
- Positive visualization (imagine success)
- Remember: You've built something amazing
- Reframe: It's a conversation, not a performance

**During Pitch:**
- Make eye contact with friendly faces
- Smile naturally
- Speak at measured pace (slower than you think)
- Pause for effect (silence is powerful)
- If you mess up, keep going (they won't notice)

**After Pitch:**
- Don't immediately check phone
- Stay present for other pitches
- Network with everyone
- Learn from others' presentations
- Regardless of outcome, you did great by trying

### Dealing with Rejection

**Remember:**
- Average startup hears "no" 20-40 times before raising money
- Every "no" brings you closer to a "yes"
- Rejection is not personal (it's business)
- Ask for feedback ("What would make this investable for you?")
- Keep iterating and improving

**Famous Rejections:**
- Airbnb: Rejected by 7 investors before success
- Uber: Investors said "Who would get in a stranger's car?"
- WhatsApp: Rejected by Facebook initially (later acquired for $19B)
