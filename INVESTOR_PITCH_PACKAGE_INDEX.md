## 💡 PRESENTATION TIPS

### For Live Presentations:

**Opening (30 seconds):**
- "We're solving a $2.3 trillion problem..."
- Hook with the pain point (60% abandon due to poor UX)

**Body (8-12 minutes):**
- Tell a story, don't just read slides
- Use the "Problem-Solution-Opportunity" framework
- Reference real examples ("Imagine you're a luxury property seeker...")
- Highlight the 30:1 LTV/CAC ratio (impressive metric)
- Show the platform (demo or screenshots)

**Close (1-2 minutes):**
- Recap: Massive market + Great team + Proven tech = High returns
- Clear ask: "$1.5M for 15.8% equity"
- Strong CTA: "Let's schedule a follow-up to discuss terms"

**Q&A:**
- Expected questions (prepare answers):
  1. "What's your customer acquisition strategy?" → Slide 10
  2. "How do you compare to Zillow?" → COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md
  3. "Is the technology scalable?" → TECHNOLOGY_OVERVIEW.md
  4. "What if Sotheby's builds an app?" → We're 2-3 years ahead
  5. "Why now?" → Market timing (post-pandemic recovery, mobile adoption)
